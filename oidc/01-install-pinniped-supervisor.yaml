                  allowPasswordGrant:
                    description: AllowPasswordGrant, when true, will allow the use of OAuth 2.0's Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant (see https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-4.3) to authenticate to the OIDC provider using a username and password without a web browser, in addition to the usual browser-based OIDC Authorization Code Flow. The Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant is not officially part of the OIDC specification, so it may not be supported by your OIDC provider. If your OIDC provider supports returning ID tokens from a Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant token request, then you can choose to set this field to true. This will allow end users to choose to present their username and password to the kubectl CLI (using the Pinniped plugin) to authenticate to the cluster, without using a web browser to log in as is customary in OIDC Authorization Code Flow. This may be convenient for users, especially for identities from your OIDC provider which are not intended to represent a human actor, such as service accounts performing actions in a CI/CD environment. Even if your OIDC provider supports it, you may wish to disable this behavior by setting this field to false when you prefer to only allow users of this OIDCIdentityProvider to log in via the browser-based OIDC Authorization Code Flow. Using the Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant means that the Pinniped CLI and Pinniped Supervisor will directly handle your end users' passwords (similar to LDAPIdentityProvider), and you will not be able to require multi-factor authentication or use the other web-based login features of your OIDC provider during Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant logins. AllowPasswordGrant defaults to false.
